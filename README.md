# Sumup Shopping cart application


Shopping app and checkout using sumup

## About flutter and some documentation on getting started with flutter

This is done as part of my H.Dip Semester 2 project.

An application that will interact with SumUp’s “Air” bluetooth device chip & pin payment device to accept payments.
This application allows you to select an event name and can start adding items that are listing under that particular event to the shopping cart.
Complete the purchase by pressing checkout and then tap the card.

Sample REST web service can be found in this link: https://github.com/MareenaJoe/sumup_rest_webservice

Prerequisites

- Registered for a merchant account via SumUp's country websites (or received a test account).
- Received SumUp card terminal: Air or Air Lite
- Requested an Affiliate (Access) Key via SumUp Dashboard for Developers.
